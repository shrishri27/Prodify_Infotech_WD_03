Task completed:Prodigy_WD_03 -tic-tac-toe web application.

I have completed my third task as a web development intern at Prodigy infotech!

1. HTML (Structure of the Page)
I learned how to:

Define the structure of a web page using semantic HTML elements like:

<html>, <head>, <body>, <div>, <h1>, <p>, <button>

Create a container for the game (.container)

Insert dynamic elements (#board) using JavaScript

 Concepts learned: HTML tags, structure, layout, IDs/classes for JavaScript interaction.

 2. CSS (Styling the Game)
I learned how to:

Style a webpage with CSS

Use Flexbox for centering the layout: display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;

Create a grid layout for the board: grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);

Add hover effects for better UX

Use class selectors (.cell, .status, .winning) and ID selectors (#board, #status)

Style buttons and add transitions

 Concepts learned: Grid and Flexbox layouts, class-based styling, hover effects, transitions.

3. JavaScript (Game Logic)
I learned how to:

a. Interactivity:
Handle click events: addEventListener("click", ...)

Dynamically create and insert elements: document.createElement("div"), appendChild()

Change text and classes of elements on the fly

b. Game State Management:
Track game state using an array: let board = Array(9).fill(null);

Switch turns between players: 'X' and 'O'

Prevent invalid moves (donâ€™t overwrite cells)

c. Win Checking Logic:
Use arrays of combinations to detect winning patterns

Check if someone has won using logical conditions

Highlight the winning cells with a class

 Restart Functionality:
Reset the board and UI with the startGame() function

 Concepts learned: DOM manipulation, conditionals, arrays, events, logic implementation, functions, UI updates
